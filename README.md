# BE
BE (fr. Bureau d'Ã©tudes, ang. Study bureau) was a project with an aim of trajectory calculation and movement rendering for a 3-axis robot.
Mathematical models calculated during the project are to be find in Models.py. 
Trajectory.py posseses all the necessary functions to calculate a trajectory from point A to B.
Render.py was created to help to visualise robot's trajectory and movements.

To test the project, uncomment lines from 18 to 27 of Demp.py and run it.
